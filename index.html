        <h1 class="display-3">Why Responsive Design?</h1>
          <p class="lead">Make your site beautiful on any screen size</p>
          <hr class="my-4">
          <p>Responsive web design mainly solves the problem of building websites for a huge variation of screen sizes. It takes a step beyond adaptive design by not only relying on a few breakpoints to determine which version of a site to display, but instead employs a single version that responds to screen size dynamically.</p>
          <p>But responsive design goes beyond just screen size, it also factors in the processing power of different devices, the likelihood of a fast internet connection, and the differences in user expectations based on the type of device they're using.</p>
          <p>For instance, a user browsing a retail website from their phone would likely appreciate the faster loading times that mobile-optimized images would provide. They'd also most likely rather not be forced to load and scroll past a large image slider that was originally built for a full desktop screen experience. Responsive design anticipates a user's needs so that a website can react accordingly.</p>
